          <h3>What is H2S (Hydrogen Sulphide) testing?</h3>
          <p>
            Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) test is a critical process for assessing
            water quality and safety. It detects the presence of this
            potentially harmful gas, helping to identify faecal contamination in
            water sources. If water is faecally contaminated, the paper strip
            will change to a brown-black colour, indicating that water is not
            safe for drinking purposes.

              <h3>How can I do H2S test?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Collect 100 mL of water sample to be tested. (e.g., water from
                  tap, stage container, spring, borehole, dam)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Insert H2S paper strip into the tube and secure it with cotton
                  wool so that it remains at the top center of the tube.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Place it in a container covered with cloth and leave it in a
                  warm place for 24-36 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Check the color change of the paper strip. If the color
                  changes to black, it means water is fecal contaminated.

          <h3>What is sanitary inspection?</h3>
          <p>
            Sanitary inspection serves as a vital tool in water quality
            monitoring, assessing the cleanliness, safety, and overall hygiene
            of water resources and environments. Its primary role is to identify
            potential routes of microbial contamination in diverse water
            sources.

              <h3>How do we monitor water quality at home?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Utilize a sanitary inspection survey form to pinpoint
                  potential pathways for faecal contamination in both your main
                  and alternative water sources.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Additionally, employ the Hydrogen Sulphide test to determine
                  the presence or absence of faecal contamination in the water.

              <h3>Is your water safe for drinking purposes?</h3>
              <p>
                While water may appear clear, it may not necessarily be safe for
                drinking. Such water can potentially lead to diarrheal and other
                waterborne diseases. Hence, it is essential for you to regularly
                monitor the quality of your water.
